# Welcome to the User Manual of AJ MCP SDK

The AJ MCP SDK is an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol designed to enable seamless integration between Large
Language Model (LLM) applications and external data sources and tools. This SDK provides the declarative APIs that make it easy for developers to
implement MCP server features in your applications.

## Why AJ MCP SDK?

Compared to the other MCP SDKs, AJ MCP SDK is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It is built on top of the Java 8, and provides a simple and
intuitive API for developers to implement MCP server features. The size of the SDK is small, making it easy to integrate into your application.

### Why still Java8?

MCP is a protocol-based framework and should therefore be more universally applicable. It should address a broader range of market demands.

Currently, the situation with developing MCP in Java is:

| Framework              | requires JDK |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Official Java MCP SDK  | jdk17+       |
| Spring AI MCP          | jdk17+       |
| Quarkus MCP server     | jdk17+       |
| langchain4j-mcp client | jdk11+       |


Given that a large number of servers still run on JDK 8, the ability to develop MCP (or MCP Server) with Java 8 is essential to ensure broad compatibility and flexibility — that’s what real freedom for MCP means.
